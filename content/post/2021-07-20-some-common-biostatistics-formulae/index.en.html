<p>I have explained some of the commonly used categorical data analysis formulae and concepts behind these formulae in Biostatistics in this post.
<!--more--></p>
<p>This post contains some commonly used formulae in categorical data analysis. These concepts are often used in contexts other than Biostatistics. So itâ€™ll not be correct to specifically say that these are Biostatistics fomulae. However, all the examples I have used here may be attributed to Biostatistics.</p>
<div id="risk" class="section level3">
<h3>1. Risk</h3>
<p>Risk indicates the likelihood of an event occurring. This is similar to the concepts of proportion and probability.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{Risk of an event } \mathcal{A}= \text{The probability or the likelihood that the event $\mathcal{A}$ will occur } = \frac{\text{number of outcome of event }\mathcal{A}}{\text{total number of outcomes}}
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\pi = \frac{n(\mathcal{A})}{\mathcal{N}}
\]</span></p>
<p>40 out of 1000 children have jaundice.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
risk ~of~ children~ having~ jaundice= \frac{40}{1000} = 0.04
\]</span></p>
<p>This means that 4% of the children suffer from jaundice.</p>
<p>Observe that the formulae of risk, likelihood and probability are similar.</p>
</div>
<div id="relative-risk" class="section level3">
<h3>2. Relative Risk</h3>
<p>The relative risk of an event is a comparison of two risks of the event at two different situations of another event. The relative risk, <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> of the success of an event A (1 denotes success) at two levels (1 and 2) of another event B,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\rho = \frac{P(A=1|B=1)}{P(A=1|B=2)}
\]</span></p>
<p>The denominator of the term above is the <strong>baseline risk</strong>. It is the risk with which the comparison is being made.</p>
